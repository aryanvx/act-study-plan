# ACT Study Schedule Generator

### A Python-powered way to plan your ACT prep (designed by a student, for students).

## Overview
This project is a simple yet powerful Python script that automatically generates a personalized ACT study calendar based on your start date, duration, and subjects. It exports an `.ics` calendar file that you can import into Google Calendar/Apple Calendar/Outlook.

I built this as part of my journey preparing for the **October 2025 ACT** — instead of relying on generic study plans, I wanted something that adapted to *my* schedule and priorities.  

This project combines my interest in **computer science** with **academic performance optimization** — turning a stressful process into a structured one (really kicking it w/ the buzzwords on this.)

## Features
- Interactive setup (enter your start date, study duration, and subjects)
- Generates daily study tasks evenly distributed across subjects
- Exports a `.ics` calendar for easy syncing with your preferred calendar app
- Fully commented, readable, and easy to modify


## Example output
You’ll get a `.ics` file (ex: `ACT_Study_Schedule_2025-10-25.ics`) that contains a structured day-by-day plan:
- `Day 1: ACT Prep: English Practice + Review`
- `Day 2: ACT Prep: Math Practice + Review`
- `Day 3: ACT Prep: Reading Practice + Review`
- …and so on.


## Future enhancements
- Add difficulty-based weighting for subjects
- Integrate score tracking or practice test reminders
- Build a web app version using Flask or React
