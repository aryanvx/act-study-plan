# ACT Study Schedule Generator

Discipline is the one algorithm you can’t fake.

Calling it a script would be to patronize it. I'd go with system.
A Python-built framework that generates a personalized ACT study calendar tailored to your start date, duration, and subjects.

It exports an .ics file you can import into Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook.

I built this while preparing for the October 2025 ACT. I was tired of generic prep plans that were more chaos than structure. So I wrote my own. Something that didn’t just tell me what to do, but when to do it.

This project sits at the intersection of computer science and discipline engineering, turning stress into system and randomness into rhythm.

Interactive setup: input your start date, study duration, and subjects

Daily tasks are distributed evenly across English, Math, Reading, and Science

Exports directly to .ics for seamless calendar integration

### Example Output
The output is a .ics file such as ACT_Study_Schedule_2025-10-25.ics.

Each day has a clear target:
```
Day 1: ACT Prep - English Practice + Review  
Day 2: ACT Prep - Math Practice + Review  
Day 3: ACT Prep - Reading Practice + Review  
```

Until routine becomes reflex.

### Future Enhancements

Difficulty-weighted scheduling

Built-in performance tracking and test reminders

Full-stack expansion using Flask or React

Fork it. Break it. Improve it.
Every iteration expands the surface area. And if luck is a function of that, then let’s get lucky.
